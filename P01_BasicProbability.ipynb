    "A probability experiment is any event whose outcomes are perfectly \\textbf{random} and exactly predicted by probabilities. The probability space (or sample space) is the collection of all possible outcomes of the experiment. A simple random sample (SRS) is a collection of outcomes drawn at random from the probability space."

    "An event is a set of outcomes. If an event $A$ is a subset of event $S$, we write:\n",

    "Determining probabilities is all about counting the number of outcomes in event $A$ and in event $S$. To simplify our work, we will use absolute value notation to indicate the \\textbf{cardinality operator}. Thus, we write $|A|$ to indicate \"the number of elements (outcomes) in set (event) $A$.\" This leads us to the main formula in discrete probability theory:\n",
